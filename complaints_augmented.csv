Specifically, it is not complying with City Order 20200622-015.  Instead of requiring and enforcing ALL patrons to properly wear masks or face coverings, both employees and management continue to only recommend following this public safety measure.  This practice was originally observed by my girlfriend and I back on June 23, 2020.  At that time, I expressed my concerns to Colin, Skye, and a manager named Chrissy.  All were informed that per local City of Austin and Travis County Ordinances, this is current law (not an option or mere recommendation).  The manager was provided with copies of both ordinances.  Each one said that they were following what corporate was telling them to do.  As a result, I researched and found contact information for Ms. Elena Kraus, Sr. Vice President and General Counsel for Walgreens at the corporate headquarters in Deerfield, IL.  I emailed her and other corporate level executives (I can provide the email at another time if necessary) to inform them of the above-mentioned non-compliance.  Said email also contained attachments of the City and County Ordinances/Orders.  Still, three weeks later, the business refuses to adhere to local law.  My girlfriend and I revisited the same location yesterday, 7-13-20, at approximately 5:40 p.m.  I spoke with Colin and asked if I was required by law to wear a mask (which I was already wearing upon arriving on the premises and entering the store).  He said that it was still only recommended per corporate guidance.  It is not requiring them to enforce anything.  Next, I spoke the Shift Manager named Skye.  She was asked the same questions...and basically gave identical answers as Colin.  When asked specifically, Do I have to wear a mask while inside?  She replied, No... not if you dont want to.  I reminded her that the same Ordinances that mandate this are still effective and are supposed to be enforced by bu  COVID-19 .Face Covering Non-Compliance - Business",3407 W WELLS BRANCH PARKWAY,7,POINT (-97.69626898 30.43940541),7,24,7,,540,36,ChIJW_3x2X_ORIYR_HkwH8qF6hc,"https://maps.google.com/?q=3407+Wells+Branch+Pkwy,+Austin,+TX+78728,+USA&ftid=0x8644ce7fd9f1fd5b:0x17ea85ca1f3079fc","3407 Wells Branch Pkwy, Austin, TX 78728, USA",,,"[""street_address""]",,

I do not know anything about his situation. I am concerned that he is ill, perhaps with COVID-19 or something else, and that perhaps he does not a have a place to safely and properly quarantine. I am also concerned he is very likely spreading infection throughout the park. For several weeks now he has been in the park coughing. He is typically near the tennis court and gazebo area and the tables and benches on that end of the park. He runs around, coughs a lot, and then drinks from the water fountain. I imagine people have been too scared of getting sick to approach him, and I understand that completely. I am hoping someone can find a way help him while also staying protected. I understand that outdoor places are safer in terms of virus spread, but it seems he is there coughing all the time and this is a neighborhood park that neighborhood residents visit regularly.

I had been told that that particular office did not see sick patients. Those patients are referred to another office.The other man in the waiting room named Eric was the only other pt there but he was coughing a lot, then took his mask off to blow his nose and then immediately touched the office key pad for his credit card. He sat down and only had his mask covering his mouth. I told him to have his mask cover his nose. He only very reluctantly barely covered the tip of his nose. I had to tell the receptionists that they needed to disinfect that keypad. They eventually did but seemed very passive and not concerned. It was only after I was called back did they take my temperature.Then later patients tended to congregate around the lab office to get their labs done. No direction to separate was given.I felt very uncomfortable the whole time. If Eric is diagnosed with Covid, are they required to let me know that I was exposed?If this is not the correct site to report this, please let me know. Thank you.

Its a small local university in south Austin. All of the staff are required to work at the office during normal business hours, even when some of us are fully capable of doing our work remotely. But wearing a facemask and keeping proper social distance are not being enforced in the office for the staffs nor visitors. The VP of operations (Anthony Holloway), who is in charge of the office and holds weekly staff meetings in a small classroom where everyone sits close together, never wears a facemask. Not even when a staff or student is sitting next to him (he is also the financial ad officer). Several other staffs also dont wear facemasks when they walk around in the office (which is a very small space) I feel unsafe working here, but Im afraid to bring this up because I need the income. I hope the city can send someone here to talk to the office manager and ensure proper health safety measure are being enforced. Please keep me anonymous. Thank you.
